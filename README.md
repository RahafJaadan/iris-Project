# Flower Type Prediction 
This project predicts the type of flower based on its characteristics, such as petal length and width, and sepal length and width. The model is deployed using **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive web interface. 

## Libraries Used
* **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis. 
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
* **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizations.

## Machine Learning Algorithm
* **Naive Bayes**: This algorithm is used to train and test the accuracy of the model.

## How to Run the Project 
1. Clone the repository:
  
  ```git clone <repository-url>```

2. Install the required libraries:
  
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
  
```streamlit run app.py```

## Model Deployment
The model is deployed using **Streamlit** to provide a simple interface for users to input flower characteristics and get a prediction.
